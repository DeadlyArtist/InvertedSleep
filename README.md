# Inverted Sleep
Minecraft mod to invert the sleep so time stops at midday and you need to sleep to start a night.

Phantoms can now simply spawn always during night, but not while creative.

Why? To give back control to the player. If you want to just build, no need to go to sleep all the time or otherwise bother with mobs. If you want to fight, just start the night. This way the night feels more like an event rather than a passive background thing.
